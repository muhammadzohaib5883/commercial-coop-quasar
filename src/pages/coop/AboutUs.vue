          There is so much redundancy in the tasks Commercial Real Estate Brokers perform from start to finish in listing
          a property. From creating CMAs and running comps to win a listing, to building marketing materials, uploading to
          search sites and blasting alerts to brokers, we repeat the same Input steps to multiple platforms over and over
          again. But along the way, information gets lost, status updates get missed, photos go out of date or get pulled
          from archives and google maps, resulting in conflicting materials entering the marketplace, not to mention
          endless hours spent at a computer screen that could be spent with clientele.

          Don’t even get us started on the money that gets wasted on over-priced, under performing, and one-dimensional
          tech platforms. We created the Commercial Co-Op to streamline the day-to-day life of a Commercial Broker and
          connect the community that keeps Brokers thriving.

          How do we know all of this? Simple. We are brokers in a small commercial firm in Denver, Colorado that got fed
          up with per broker tech costs of over $2,500/month and decided there has to be a better way. When the pandemic
          hit, we knew it would be more important than ever to work smarter and save money. We built this product for US
          and everyone we work with.

            Marsha was born in Denver, CO and has spent her life in the area. Marsha started out working in the banking
            industry before moving over to the mortgage industry. When she was first hired by Jay Soneff, she headed the
            Mortgage and Finance Division. She specialized in Commercial Lending and fulfilling long term goals of the
            Jamis Companies’ clientele. During this time, Marsha assisted Jay in his real estate and development division.
            Before the housing crisis of 2008, Jay and Marsha made a joint decision that the Mortgage and Finance Sector
            was far too unsettled to offer great service to their clients, closing down that section of the business.
            During Marsha’s 17 years with Jamis Companies, she has tackled many different positions to assist Jay in his
            businesses.

            broker in the state. Jay went back to school and received his Master’s degree in Construction Finance and
            Management from University of Denver in 1995.
            As a developer, agent and investor in multiple real estate platforms, Jay has tremendous experience dealing
